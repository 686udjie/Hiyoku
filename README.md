# Hiyoku

Free, open-source anime player and manga reader for iOS and iPadOS

# Important

This app is a fork of [Aidoku](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku) with a built-in player supporting [Sora](https://github.com/cranci1/Sora) extensions. It was created to COMPLETELY remove the need to switch between separate apps for watching anime and reading manga, now you can do both in one place

# Mentions

Shoutout to [Skitty](https://github.com/Skittyblock), the guy that made Aidoku, and to [Cranci1](https://github.com/cranci1), who made Sora, give them lots of hugs! :3

# Installation

Currently, the only way to download Hiyoku is via an ipa, which can be found in [releases](https://github.com/686udjie/Hiyoku/releases)
